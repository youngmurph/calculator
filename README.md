Calculator

This is the simple calculator that I created in order to complete the final project of The Odin Project's Foundations course. 

The body of the calculator was created using HTML and CSS, while the calculator's operations are handled using Javascript.

This calculator is designed to perform only one operation at a time. As such, it is not possible to complete an operation which contains more than one operator. I intend to return to this when I have developed my skills further in order to improve the functionality.
